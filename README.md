# DataProductsProject
This project is for the Data Product Coursera Course of Johns Hopkins University, and the goal is to build Shiny application and deploy it on the web.
I choose to create an app that works with the Iris dataset and you can choose which kind of graph you want to visualize. Additionally you can choose which are the X and Y variable for the plot from the Iris dataset. Finally for the Scatterplot you can visualize K-means algorithm working selecting the number of clusters.
